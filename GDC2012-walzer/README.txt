	/*
	As I shown on presentation, create a cocos2d-x project from template, 
	copy and paste source code and images, build and run, and it works.
	Well, I forgot to change the orientation, it's easy to fix.

    - tweejump-android
	/*
	The same to tweejump-ios, this time we create a cocos2d-x project from create-android-project.sh,
	copy->paste->build->run, everything is ok. Don't forget to modify the orientation
